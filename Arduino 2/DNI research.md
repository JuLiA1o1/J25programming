 ### **1.** INFORMATION
"**DNI**" are the initials of "**D**ocumento **N**acional de **I**dentidad"

This document is commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries, and it's  used as an identification card for citizens

The **DNI number** is a unique identifier assigned to each individual, and it often includes both numbers and letters.

These principles can vary by country, as each government determines the structure based on factors such as population size and administrative divisions.

 ### **2.** ANALYSIS
The logic behind the structure of the DNI number can vary from country to country, but there are general principles that guide its formation:

**2.1 Geographic Code:** 
The **initial digits** often represent the **geographic region or province** where the individual is registered.

**2.2 Sequential Numbering:**
After regional code digits; numerical digits are assigned sequentially to **identify individuals within that region**.


**2.3 Check Digit or Letter:**
A check digit or letter is usually included at the **end of the number**. Calculated using an **algorithm applied** to the preceding digits to **detect errors**.

**2.4 Inclusion of Letters:**
Some DNIs may incorporate letters for added **variation and complexity**.

**2.5 Format Variations:**
Different countries may have variations in DNI format, including the placement of letters and numbers.

### 3. HOW TO CHECK DIGIT or LETTER: 
check digit or letter in a DNI (Documento Nacional de Identidad) is typically calculated using a mathematical algorithm. The specific algorithm can vary by country, and the process may involve a combination of mathematical operations to ensure that the DNI is valid.

1. **Assign Values to Digits:**
Assign numerical values to each digit in the DNI, excluding the check digit itself
2. **Apply Weights:**
Multiply each digit by a specific weight. The weights can be different for each digit
3. **Summation:**
Sum the results of the multiplication
4. **Modulo Operation:**
Perform a modulo operation on the sum, typically using a specific modulus
**ex**; modulo 10
5. **Calculate Check Digit:**
The result of the modulo operation is used to determine the check digit. It might be subtracted from a predetermined value or converted to a letter based on a mapping.
6. **Append Check Digit:**
Add the calculated check digit to the end of the original DNI.
