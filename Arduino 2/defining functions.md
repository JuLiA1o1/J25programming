## Exercise 1
:::info
Write the signature (the definition of the function) of the following...
:::

1. findTheLeg is a function that given an hypotenuse and another leg is going to return a leg. Legs and hypothenuses are doubles.

**double findTheLeg (double hypotenuse, double leg)**

2. validateDNI is a function that given a string is going to return true if it’s a valid DNI and false otherwise.

**bool validateDNI (string x)**


3. createBigHouseInMinecraft is a function that it’s going to try to create a big luxury house in survival in Minecraft. If it achieves it, the function is going to return true and is going to return false if there was an error

**bool createBigHouseInMinecraft (bigLuxuryHouse)**
:::success
CORRECTION; bool createBigHouseInMinecraft ()
:::
4. createBigHouseInMinecraft is a function that it’s going to try to create a big luxury house in survival in Minecraft. There is a parameter x that is the IP where the server is (the object IP stores IP addresses) If it achieves it, the function is going to return true and is going to return false if there was an error

**bool createBigHouseInMinecraft (IP server)**

5. Define a function that is going to print the n number of the fibonacci series given as an integer. The name of the function is printFib

**print.ln printFib (number n)**
:::success
CORRECTION; void printFib (int n)
:::

6. Define a function that is going to sound a scale given the number of the pin where the buzzer is attached. The name of the function is soundScale.

**void soundScale (pin x)**
:::success
CORRECTION; void soundScale (int pin)
:::

7. Define a function that is going to sound a scale given the number of the pin where the buzzer is attached and a boolean that is true if we want to play a chormatic scale and false otherwise. The name of the function is soundScale

**void soudScale (int pin, boolean chormatic)**

8. Define a function that is given the milliseconds that have passed, is going to return if it’s time to go to the next class or not. The name of the function is nextClassAlready. Milliseconds use the type long.

**bool nextClassAlready (long milliseconds)**

9. Define a function that is given the milliseconds that have passed, is going to return if it’s time to go to the next class or not. The coding for knowing if it’s the next class is that is going to return 1 if we have to go to the next class and 0 otherwise. The name of the function is nextClassAlready. Milliseconds use the type long.

**bool nextClassAlready (long milliseconds)**

10. Define the Function HTTPConnect that is going to return a code that is an integer for the status of the connection given the URL as a string

**HTTPConnect (int URL)**
:::success
CORRECTION; int HTTPConnect(string URL) 
:::

## Exercise 2
:::info
fuera parentesi: lo que devuelve 
dentro parentesi: (tipos de variable que das)
:::

1. Define the function startWithQuixote that if you send an String is going to return an string that is the same but it will start with "En un lugar de la Mancha… ".

**void startWithQuixote (string "En un lugar de la Mancha…")**
:::success
CORRECTION; string startWithQuixote (string x)
:::

2. Define a function that is going to output on a screen (or through serial) the inverse (1/x) of the integer number that you send to it. The name of the function is inverseNumber

**inverseNumber (int x, serial 1/x)**
:::success
CORRECTION; void inverseNumber (int x)
:::

3. Define a function in C++ that is going to return true if it’s a “good day” and false otherwise. The name of the function is “isItAGoodDay”.

**bool isItAGoodDay ()**

4. Define a function in C++ that is going to return you the volume of a cilinder given it’s radius and it’s height. Numbers can be decimals. The name of the function is volumeCilinder.

**void volumeCilinder (double radius, double heigh)**
:::success
CORRECTION; double volumeCilinder (double radius, double heigh)
:::

5. Define a function called “isThereAny Beetlejuice” that is going to analyse a string given as a parameter and is going to return true if the name “Beetlejuice” is part of the string and false otherwise

**bool isThereAnyBeetlejuice (string x)**

6. Define a function that is called notOver5 that given an integer is going to return the same integer if it’s not over 5 and 5 if it’s equal or bigger than five.

**void notOver5 (int x<5, int x=>5)**

:::success
CORRECTION; int notOver5 (int n)
:::

7. Define a function called singLullaby that is going to tone a lullaby when called.

**void singLullaby (tone lullaby)**
:::success
CORRECTION; void singLullaby ()
:::
