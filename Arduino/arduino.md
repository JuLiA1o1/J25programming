## Special message ##
This special message firstly was with the line it's shown above

**Serial.println("special message its gonna to get started in a few seconds");**

but the arduino memory was full as the arduino said;

**Not enough memory; see https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360013825179 for tips on reducing your footprint.
Error during build: data section exceeds available space in board**

So I decided to deleated and even the space was 97% used as it wasn't full, it worked

### EXPLANATION
**void setup():** This is a function that runs once when the Arduino is powered up or reset. In this case, it initializes serial communication using Serial.begin(9600). The number 9600 is the baud rate, which represents the speed of data transmission.

**void loop():** This is the main function that runs repeatedly as long as the Arduino is powered. It contains the main code that is executed in a loop.

**Serial.println("..."):** This function prints the specified text to the serial monitor. The provided code prints a series of ASCII art messages, creating a stylized visual representation of text. The messages include the "special message" and the name "JULIA PAHISSA."

**delay(1000):** This function introduces a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before the loop repeats. This delay creates a pause between each set of printed messages.
