Oh Mummy Pig, it's time for shame,
<br>
I've spotted it, I know your game,
<br>
You need to see a pro for help,
<br>
If you succeed, I know your name!
<br>
<br>
From show to show your plans unfurl,
<br>
Oft, you involve your little girl,
<br>
Insidious, yet not hard to spot,
<br>
Your friends' heads must be in a whirl!
<br>
<br>
My heart bleeds for your husband true,
<br>
Whose love is clearly just for you,
<br>
But poor sap hasn't realised,
<br>
That every day you turn the screw!
<br>
<br>
You're trying to kill him. See! I know!
<br>
The kite was stuck, you made him go,
<br>
And climb a sapling, far too thin,
<br>
It bent, he fell, just luck t'was low.
<br>
<br>
So Mummy Pig, just be aware,
<br>
There's loads of us who sit and stare,
<br>
To make sure that you don't succeed,
<br>
Or escalate, you wouldn't dare!
<br>
